                        "Never Gonna Give You Up" is the debut single recorded by English singer and songwriter Rick Astley, released on 27 July 1987. It is one of Rick Astley's most famous songs. It was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman, and was released as the first single from Astley's debut album, Whenever You Need Somebody (1987). The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed at the top of the chart for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year. It eventually topped the charts in 25 countries, including the United States and West Germany.[6] The song won Best British Single at the 1988 Brit Awards.<br><br>
                        In 2008, Astley won the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Act Ever with the song, as a result of collective voting from thousands of people on the Internet, due to the <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rickrolling</a> meme.[7] The song is considered Astley's signature song and it is often played at the end of his live concerts. The music video for the song has become the basis for the "Rickrolling" Internet meme, in which a user expecting entirely unrelated content is shown the video.<br><br>
                        In 2019, Astley recorded and released a '<a href="https://youtu.be/GHMjD0Lp5DY">Pianoforte</a>' version of the song for his album <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">The Best of Me</a>, which features a new piano arrangement.[8]<br><br>
